/**
 * ForkJoinPool and ForkJoinTask are a related pair of Java features for dispatching work to pools of threads
 *
 * For ForkJoinPool, several methods are used to dispatch concurrency objects - submit, execute, invoke, invokeAll,
 * which take a variety of input types - Runnables, Callables, ForkJoinTasks and Collections of Callables.
 *
 * The call of such a method indicates an intention to dispatch work, potentially to a supplementary thread, or
 * (at the discretion of the runtime) to the same thread as the call site.
